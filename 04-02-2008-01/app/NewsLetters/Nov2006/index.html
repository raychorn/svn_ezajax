									<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 Version 0.94 was just released and can be <a href="http://www.1.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX_Community_Edition_v094_30-Day_Trial.exe" target="_blank">downloaded from here</a> OR <a href="http://www.2.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX_Community_Edition_v094_30-Day_Trial.exe" target="_blank">from here</a>.</p>
									<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 Version 0.94 is the version that adds a ton of additional JavaScript code you can use.  Version 0.94 also implements native JSON support that provides an interface to all existing Web 2.0 API's that use JSON as well as the ability for you to use ezAJAX to code your own Web 2.0 API's that use JSON.  Recently Yahoo contacted our Development Staff to have us code a unique Cross-Domain AJAX Method that provides an interface to allow you to consume Web 2.0 API's that use JSON Cross-Domain.  You can see our sample Yahoo Web 2.0 API Example at our site right now.  Version 0.94 also implements the automatic coding of Server-Side Code Stubs for AJAX Server Commands.  Our self-coding system that automatically generates AJAX Server Command Stub CFC's will save YOU a ton of programming time while maintaining the integiryt of the whole framework.  You can read all about this in our current Programmer's Guide that can be <a href="http://www.1.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX(tm) Community Edition Programmers Guide v0.94.doc" target="_blank">download here in Word doc form</a> OR <a href="http://www.2.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX(tm) Community Edition Programmers Guide v0.94.doc" target="_blank">download here in Word doc form</a> OR <a href="http://www.1.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX_tm_ Community Edition Programmers Guide v0.94.pdf" target="_blank">download here as a PDF</a> OR <a href="http://www.2.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX_tm_ Community Edition Programmers Guide v0.94.pdf" target="_blank">download here as a PDF</a>.</p>
									<p align="justify">Recently our Installer Program was updated to filter-out invalid Domain Names and Server Names.  Keep in mind, when we talk about Domain Names or Server Names we are making reference to the name your web server responds to when forming URL's for your web pages.  For instance, let's say your web server's Domain Name is "localhost".  A typical URL for your web server might look like this "http://localhost/index.html".  Likewise, if your web server's Domain Name is "www.myServer.com" a typical URL might look like this "http://www.myServer.com/index.html".  Also keep in mind there is no need to specify the port number for your specific web server when entering your Server Name or Domain Name during the Registration process.</p>
									<p align="justify">The ezAJAX&#8482 Installer Program, which can be <a href="http://www.1.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX_Community_Edition_v094_30-Day_Trial.exe" target="_blank">downloaded here</a> OR <a href="http://www.2.ez-ajax.com/downloads_433611211010024813/ezAJAX_Community_Edition_v094_30-Day_Trial.exe" target="_blank">from here</a>, requires your Email Address and Domain Name or Server Name from your web server during the Installation and Registration Process.</p>
									<p align="justify">If you encountered any problems while installing ezAJAX&#8482 you may contact our <a href="mailto:support@ez-ajax.com?subject=I am having a problem, can you help me ?">Support Department</a> to get your problems resolved quickly and efficiently.  The ezAJAX&#8482 Installer Program supports Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Windows 2003 and ColdFusion MX 7.  You might be surprised to learn we have recently developed a technique that allows you to deploy the FREE Developer's Edition of ColdFusion MX 7 in your Production Environment - in fact, our unique AJAX Framework makes this possible. To learn the details simply purchase a Any Perpetual ezAJAX Runtime License and we will share the details with you at no additional cost.</p>

									<p align="justify">Our Talented Development Staff can easily add any features you may wish to request.  We have done this for Yahoo already !  We value your <a href="mailto:support@ez-ajax.com?subject=I would like to make a suggestion to help improve your product...">feedback</a>.</p>

						<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 Version 0.95 to be released soon, will contain an optimized JavaScript loader that greatly speeds the start-up time for all ezAJAX Apps.</p>
						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>The ezAJAX&#8482 Design Philosophy</center></span>

						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>The ezAJAX&#8482 Design Philosophy (contin.)</center></span>
						<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 uses a unique proprietary technique that allows ColdFusion Query Objects to be quickly transferred from the Server to the browser client using JSON.  This allows Query of Queries to be performed using the client to minimize having to go back to the Server just to run Queries on Result Sets that were previously fetched from your database.  Query Objects can also be cached in the client and used at a later time whenever data is needed by the client.  We have extended JSON to support our own proprietary client-side Query Objects that support client-side Query of Queries.</p>
						<p align="justify">The ezAJAX&#8482 way of transferring data from the server to the client allows the data objects to be used immediately at the speed of thought.  This makes your AJAX Clients work much faster when using ezAJAX&#8482.</p>
						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>Future release of ezAJAX&#8482 will have the following features:</center></span>
						<UL>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Shopping Cart GUI</b> - This allows ezAJAX&#8482 web apps to use a client-based Shopping Cart that interfaces with Paypal to process payments with the ability to store Invoices in the databases.  The Invoices can later be matched to payments to allow products to be shipped or to allow access to be granted based on the payments that have been processed.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Interactive Programming Guide</b> - Step By Step Web Based Programming Guide that demonstrates how to use ezAJAX&#8482 to program AJAX based web apps quickly and easily.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Thought Bubble GUI</b> - <b>Ready now !</b> This allows a pop-up thought bubble to be added to ezAJAX&#8482 web apps.  Thought Bubbles can be made to follow the mouse cursor while the visitor is hovering over an anchor link, for instance.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>JSON Support</b> - <b>Ready now !</b> ezAJAX fully supports JSON and JSON based Web 2.0 API's.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>JavaScript based Charts and Graphs Support</b> - Professional business charts and graphs using nothing but JavaScript and DHTML.  You can test-drive this feature via the <a href="(http://rabid.contentopia.net/blog/samples/semiconductors/wafer-analysis/index.cfm" target="_blank">Semiconductor Wafer Analysis Sample App</a> currently availble at our site.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Interactive JavaScript Games</b> - it is our goal to support those who wish to program interactive games using ezAJAX&#8482.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Enterprise Edition</b> - <b>Ready now !</b> The Enterprise Edition support the ability to transfer many ColdFusion Query Objects from the server to the client as well as our own proprietary Geonosis Data Engine that transforms any ODBC/JDBC Data Source into a powerful Object-Oriented Networked Database that makes it possible to use any data type of any data schema without the need to code SQL or setup database Tables unless you really want to.  Geonosis fully supports all existing SQL based ODBC/JDBC Databases that ColdFusion can be made to interface with including but not limited to the following: SQL Server 6.5 through SQL Server 2005, Oracle and mySQL 5.x.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>PHP, ASP and ASP.Net Support</b> - We have plans to provide an easy way to use the ColdFusion Developer's Edition as an ezAJAX&#8482 Server to ease the transition to ColdFusion for those who wish to use it.  The ColdFusion Developer's Edition is a complete Enterprise Edition that is FREE but limited to 3 IP addresses with simultaneous access to the ColdFusion Server.  Our PHP Connector will allow your PHP Server to use the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition via a Proxy in the form of a PHP Connector component we will make available to you at no cost.  Our ASP Connector will allow your IIS Server to use the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition via a Proxy in the form of an ASP Connector component we will make available to you at no cost.  Our ASP.Net Connector will allow your IIS Server to use the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition via a Proxy in the form of an ASP.Net Connector component we will make available to you at no cost.  We also have plans for developing an Apache Connector to allow your Apache Web Server to act as a Proxy for the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition.  You could also use a Proxy Utility Program to perform this function, if you chose to.  Any process that redirects web hits from one service to another is a Proxy Service.  The FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition will respond to web hits that are redirected through a single IP address as though those hits were sent directly to the ColdFusion Developer's Edition.</p></LI>
