									<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 Version 0.92 was recently released and can be <a href="http://www.ez-ajax.com/ezAJAX_Community_Edition_v092_30-Day_Trial_Installer.exe" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>.</p>
									<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 Version 0.92 is the version that implemented compatibility with Dojo 0.3.1 - you can test-drive our <a href="http://www.ez-ajax.com/dojo-0.3.1-ajax/demos/widget/Mail.html" target="_blank">Dojo Sample Mail App here</a>.  You can view the source code for the Dojo Sample Mail App by visiting our <a href="http://www.ez-ajax.com" target="_blank">web site</a>.</p>
									<p align="justify">Recently our Installer Program was updated to filter-out invalid Domain Names and Server Names.  Keep in mind, when we talk about Domain Names or Server Names we are making reference to the name your web server responds to when forming URL's for your web pages.  For instance, let's say your web server's Domain Name is "localhost".  A typical URL for your web server might look like this "http://localhost/index.html".  Likewise, if your web server's Domain Name is "www.myServer.com" a typical URL might look like this "http://www.myServer.com/index.html".</p>
									<p align="justify">The ezAJAX&#8482 Installer Program, which can be <a href="http://www.ez-ajax.com/ezAJAX_Community_Edition_v092_30-Day_Trial_Installer.exe" target="_blank">downloaded here</a>, requires your Email Address and Domain Name from your web server during the Installation and Registration Process.</p>
									<p align="justify">If you encountered any problems while installing ezAJAX&#8482 you may contact our <a href="mailto:support@ez-ajax.com?subject=I am having a problem, can you help me ?">Support Department</a> to get any problems resolved.  The ezAJAX&#8482 Installer Program supports Windows XP, Windows 2000 and Windows 2003.</p>
									<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>We want your Feedback</center></span>

						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>New Features Coming Soon !</center></span>
						<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 Version 0.93 to be released soon, will contain a slick Tabbed Interface that is now being used by our home page. Our Tabbed Interface allows for one or many content pages to be associated with each Tab. This allows the programmer to define links within content pages that can link directly to a content page or a tab.  This allows a book with chapters to be created using our Tabbed Interface.  The content page that contains the index to the book would have links to content pages; the tabs would allow navigation to chapter headings.  Navigation from content page to content page would allow the site visitor to turn each content page or jump between content pages.</p>
						<p align="justify">Most other Tabbed Interfaces, such as the one found in Dojo 0.3.1, does not have the power and flexibility of the ezAJAX&#8482 Tabbed Interface.  You can expect many more powerful web development features to be added to ezAJAX&#8482 in the coming weeks and months.</p>
						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>The ezAJAX&#8482 Design Philosophy</center></span>
						<p align="justify">The ezAJAX&#8482 way of doing things is to bundle a lot of value into a package you can use and reuse and then deploy and redeploy.</p>
						<p align="justify">We provide you with a complete Applicaton Framework that is jammed-packed with 10,000+ lines of code.</p>
						<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 was hand-crafted by our top-notch programmers who used the entire Application Framework to code numerous AJAX Applications during the past 3 years.</p>
						<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 exists to save you time and money.  How long would it take you to code 10,000+ lines of ColdFusion and JavaScript code ?  Let ezAJAX&#8482 save you months of programming time.  Get your next AJAX Web App done faster by using ezAJAX&#8482.</p>

						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>The ezAJAX&#8482 Design Philosophy (contin.)</center></span>
						<p align="justify">ezAJAX&#8482 uses a unique proprietary technique that allows ColdFusion Query Objects to be quickly transferred from the Server to the JavaScript client.  This allows Query of Queries to be performed using the client to minimize having to go back to the Server just to run Queries.  Query Objects can also be cached in the client and used at a later time whenever data is needed by the client.  JSON does not typically support the ability to perform Queries on Data Objects once those data objects reach the client.</p>
						<p align="justify">The ezAJAX&#8482 way of transferring data from the server to the client allows the data objects to be used immediately with no need to perform any kind of JSON-like data transformations - no need to parse the data like XML does - no need to spend time decoding the data.  This makes AJAX Clients work much faster when using ezAJAX&#8482.</p>
						<span style="background-color: silver; width: 100%;"><center>Future release of ezAJAX&#8482 will have the following features:</center></span>
						<UL>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Shopping Cart GUI</b> - This allows ezAJAX&#8482 web apps to use a client-based Shopping Cart that interfaces with Paypal to process payments with the ability to store Invoices in the databases.  The Invoices can later be matched to payments to allow products to be shipped or to allow access to be granted based on the payments that have been processed.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Interactive Programming Guide</b> - Step By Step Web Based Programming Guide that demonstrates how to use ezAJAX&#8482 to program AJAX based web apps quickly and easily.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Thought Bubble GUI</b> - This allows a pop-up thought bubble to be added to ezAJAX&#8482 web apps.  Thought Bubbles can be made to follow the mouse cursor while the visitor is hovering over an anchor link, for instance.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>JSON Support</b> - We plan on providing an optional JSON Interface to allow those who prefer to use JSON to do so.  We believe our own proprietary method for transferring data from the ezAJAX&#8482 Server to the client is much more powerful than JSON however we also realize we need to provide a way to allow people who are already using JSON to transition into using the ezAJAX&#8482 method.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>JavaScript based Charts and Graphs Support</b> - Professional business charts and graphs using nothing but JavaScript and DHTML.  You can test-drive this feature via the <a href="(http://rabid.contentopia.net/blog/samples/semiconductors/wafer-analysis/index.cfm" target="_blank">Semiconductor Wafer Analysis Sample App</a> currently availble at our site.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Interactive JavaScript Games</b> - it is our goal to support those who wish to program interactive games using ezAJAX&#8482.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>Enterprise Edition</b> - This edition uses a much faster encoding technique for passing ColdFusion Query Objects back to the client as well as no limit on the number of Query Objects that can be passed back to the client.</p></LI>
							<LI><p align="justify"><b>PHP, ASP and ASP.Net Support</b> - We have plans to provide an easy way to use the ColdFusion Developer's Edition as an ezAJAX&#8482 Server to ease the transition to ColdFusion for those who wish to use it.  The ColdFusion Developer's Edition is a complete Enterprise Edition that is FREE but limited to 3 IP addresses with simultaneous access to the ColdFusion Server.  Our PHP Connector will allow your PHP Server to use the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition via a Proxy in the form of a PHP Connector component we will make available to you at no cost.  Our ASP Connector will allow your IIS Server to use the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition via a Proxy in the form of an ASP Connector component we will make available to you at no cost.  Our ASP.Net Connector will allow your IIS Server to use the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition via a Proxy in the form of an ASP.Net Connector component we will make available to you at no cost.  We also have plans for developing an Apache Connector to allow your Apache Web Server to act as a Proxy for the FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition.  You could also use a Proxy Utility Program to perform this function, if you chose to.  Any process that redirects web hits from one service to another is a Proxy Service.  The FREE ColdFusion Developer's Edition will respond to web hits that are redirected through a single IP address as though those hits were sent directly to the ColdFusion Developer's Edition.</p></LI>
